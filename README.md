## Cowread

Welcome to **Cowread**

### "But cows cant _read_!"
  They can _now_! Cowread is a simple and _easy to use_ program that searches any local file for a defined search term and pipes the output through cowread. Why _read_ your files when you can **cowread** them?!

### Why?
  * Because everybody's got to start somewhere. 
  * I started with Cowread. 
  * Cowsay is a tutorial exercise for me to learn the basics of shell scripting.
  * I wrote Cowread the same day I first used the command line.
  * Yes, this list is an arbitrary exercise in markdown.
  * I'm new at that too.

### What makes Cowread such a great tutorial program?
##### Three things.
1. Cowread is **simple**. It is a short script that I was able to write in a few minutes.
2. Cowread is **integrative**. It utilizes many of the commands I learned early on, including 'grep' and piping.
3. Cowread is **_Fun_**. It's a _talking cow_!
